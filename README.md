# Private Membership Proof

This project implements a Private Membership Proof (PMP) system, enabling users to prove their membership in a protocol without disclosing their identity. The system leverages Merkle Trees and zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to provide cryptographic privacy and scalability.

## Overview

In this prototype, the following steps are performed:

1. Merkle Tree Generation:
   - A Merkle Tree is constructed from an array of strings representing the membership list.
   - The root of the Merkle Tree acts as a cryptographic commitment to the membership list.

2. Zero-Knowledge Proof of Membership:
   - A user can generate a zk-SNARK proof using their membership string and the Merkle Tree path.
   - The proof is validated against the Merkle root, ensuring the user's membership without revealing their actual identity.

This approach combines the efficiency of Merkle Trees with the privacy guarantees of zk-SNARKs, making it suitable for decentralized applications where privacy and scalability are crucial.

## Future Work

This project is a prototype and can be extended to

- Optimize Performance: Improve Merkle Tree generation and zk-SNARK proof efficiency.
- Enhance Usability: Create a frontend interface for easier interaction.
- Support Larger Membership Lists: Explore optimizations for handling millions of members.
- Integrate with Blockchain Systems: Use smart contracts to manage Merkle roots and proof verification.
